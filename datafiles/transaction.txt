Transactions: multiple DB operations handled as an atomic unit

A transaction is an executing program that includes some database operations, such as reading from the database, or applying insertions, deletions, or updates to the database

At the end of the transaction, it must leave the database in a valid or consistent state that satisfies all the constraints specified on the database schema.

A single transaction may involve any number of retrieval operations , and any number of update operations. These retrievals and updates will together form an atomic unit of work against the database. 

For example, a transaction to apply a bank withdrawal will typically read the user account record, check if there is a sufficient balance, and then update the record by the withdrawal amount.

A large number of commercial applications running against relational databases in online transaction processing (OLTP) systems are executing transactions at rates that reach several hundred per second.
