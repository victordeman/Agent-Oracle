First normal form (1NF) is now considered to be part of the formal definition of a relation in the basic (flat) relational model; historically, it was defined to disallow multivalued attributes, composite attributes, and their combinations. It states that the domain of an attribute must include only atomic (simple, indivisible) values and that the value of any attribute in a tuple must be a single value from the domain of that attribute. Hence, 1NF disallows having a set of values, a tuple of values, or a combination of both as an attribute value for a single tuple. In other words, 1NF disallows relations within relations or relations as attribute values within tuples. The only attribute values permitted by 1NF are single atomic (or indivisible) values.

First normal form also disallows multivalued attributes that are themselves composite. These are called nested relations because each tuple can have a relation within it.

remedy: Form new relations for each multivalued attribute or nested relation.
