The relational model represents the database as a collection of relations.

Informally, each relation resembles a table of values or, to some extent, a flat file of records. It is called a flat file because each record has a simple linear or flat structure.

However, there are important differences between relations and files.

When a relation is thought of as a table of values, each row in the table represents a collection of related data values. A row represents a fact that typically corresponds to a real-world entity or relationship. The table name and column names are used to help to interpret the meaning of the values in each row.

A relation (or relation state)4 r of the relation schema R(A1, A2, ..., An), also denoted by r(R), is a set of n-tuples r = {t1, t2, ..., tm}. Each n-tuple t is an ordered list of n values t =<v1, v2, ..., vn>, where each value vi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, is an element of dom(Ai) or is a special NULL value.
