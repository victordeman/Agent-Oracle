Whenever the owner A of a relation R grants a privilege on R to another account B,the privilege can be given to B with or without the GRANT OPTION. If the GRANTOPTION is given, this means that B can also grant that privilege on R to other accounts. Suppose that B is given the GRANT OPTION by A and that B then grants the privilege on R to a third account C, also with the GRANT OPTION. In this way, privileges on R can propagate to other accounts without the knowledge of the owner of R. If the owner account A now revokes the privilege granted to B, all the privileges that B propagated based on that privilege should automatically be revoked by the system.

An Example to Illustrate Granting and Revoking of Privileges: Suppose that the DBA creates four accounts A1, A2, A3, and A4 and wants only A1 to be able to create base relations. To do this, the DBA must issue the following GRANT command in SQL: GRANT CREATETAB TO A1; The CREATETAB (create table) privilege gives account A1 the capability to create new database tables (base relations) and is hence an account privilege. This privilege was part of earlier versions of SQL but is now left to each individual system implementation to define.
