A relation schema R is in 2NF if every nonprime attribute A in R is fully functionally dependent on the primary key of R.

Definition: A relation schema R is in second normal form (2NF) if every nonprime attribute A in R is not partially dependent on any key of R.

Second normal form (2NF) is based on the concept of full functional dependency. A functional dependency X → Y is a full functional dependency if removal of any attribute A from X means that the dependency does not hold any more; that is, for any attribute A ε X, (X – {A}) does not functionally determine Y.

The test for 2NF involves testing for functional dependencies whose left-hand side attributes are part of the primary key. If the primary key contains a single attribute, the test need not be applied at all.

If a relation schema is not in 2NF, it can be second normalized or 2NF normalized into a number of 2NF relations in which nonprime attributes are associated only with the part of the primary key on which they are fully functionally dependent.
