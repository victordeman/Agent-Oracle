Third normal form (3NF) is based on the concept of transitive dependency. A functional dependency X → Y in a relation schema R is a transitive dependency if there exists a set of attributes Z in R that is neither a candidate key nor a subset of any key of R, and both X → Z and Z → Y hold.

According to Codd’s original definition, a relation schema R is in 3NF if it satisfies 2NF and no nonprime attribute of R is transitively dependent on the primary key.

Definition: A relation schema R is in third normal form (3NF) if, whenever a nontrivial functional dependency X → A holds in R, either (a) X is a superkey of R, or (b) A is a prime attribute of R.

Test: Relation should not have a nonkey attribute functionally determined by another nonkey attribute (or by a set of nonkey attributes). That is, there should be no transitive dependency of a nonkey attribute on the primary key.

Remedy : Decompose and set up a relation that includes the nonkey attribute(s) that functionally determine(s) other nonkey attribute(s).
