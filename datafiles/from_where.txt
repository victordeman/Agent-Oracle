The basic form of the SELECT statement, sometimes called a mapping or a select-from-where block, is formed of the three clauses SELECT, FROM, and WHERE.
#$%
The syntax is : SELECT <attribute list> FROM <table list> WHERE <condition>; where <attribute list> is a list of attribute names whose values are to be retrieved by the query, <table list> is a list of the relation names required to process the query, <condition> is a conditional (Boolean) expression that identifies the tuples to be retrieved by the query.
#$%
Example: SELECT Bdate, Address FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Fname= "John" AND Minit= "B" AND Lname= "Smith"; This query involves only the EMPLOYEE relation listed in the FROM clause. The query selects the individual EMPLOYEE tuples that satisfy the condition of the WHERE clause, then projects the result on the Bdate and Address attributes listed in the SELECT clause.
#$%
The SELECT clause of SQL specifies the attributes whose values are to be retrieved, which are called the projection attributes, and the WHERE clause specifies the Boolean condition that must be true for any retrieved tuple, which is known as the selection condition. 
#$%
The SELECT and FROM clauses are required in all SQL queries. The WHERE is optional.
